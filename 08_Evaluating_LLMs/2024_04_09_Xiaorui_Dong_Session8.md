A particularly impactful application of LLMs in science, I think, is their role as tutors or consultants, guiding researchers to more effectively utilize computational tools and methodologies in their work. This application extends beyond code generation or debugging; it also encompasses extending documentation information, explaining arguments, offering usage examples, interpreting errors, suggesting the most suitable computational tools and practices, etc. This utility stems from several key observations:

* Extensive Training: Modern LLMs are trained on a broad spectrum of open-source codes and content from platforms like Stack Overflow, making them a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of computational science, algorithms, and related disciplines.
* Cross-disciplinary Expertise: Bridging the gap in expertise between computational science and specific scientific or engineering disciplines is a common challenge for researchers. LLMs can provide valuable support here, offering computational insights that researchers might not have.
* Awareness of Tools: Researchers often have a clear understanding of their problem-solving framework but might lack awareness of the best tools available. LLMs can illuminate these tools, potentially suggesting more effective alternatives.
* Computational Nuances: The intricacies of software versions, dependencies, and compilations often fall outside a researcher’s expertise. LLMs can navigate these nuances, offering guidance that streamlines the research process.
* Resource Limitations: In environments where resources for enhancing computational skills or consulting are limited, LLMs can serve as an accessible, knowledgeable companion, aiding researchers in pushing their projects forward.
* Interactive Testing: the precision of the models is not the primary concern—thanks to the interactive nature of the models, where users can test and refine the output—the focus shifts towards motivating and informing researchers, guiding them in employing specific software packages effectively and deploying them into production environments.

When evaluating this tools, there are several factors should be considered:
* Accuracy and Relevance: While the precise accuracy of the models’ outputs may not be critically important due to the iterative nature of their use, the relevance of the information provided is crucial for guiding researchers effectively.
* Confidentiality and Accessibility: Given the models' potential to recall information from their training data, it's vital to ensure they do not disclose confidential information. Additionally, providing details on the accessibility (e.g., licensing of suggested codes or tools) is important, aligning with ethical guidelines and legal requirements.
* Motivational Impact: The success of LLMs in this role should also be measured by their ability to motivate and inform researchers. This is related to but not fully captured by the first factor. Things like helpfulness, insightfulness, and full life-cycle effectiveness are hard to quantify by simple forms of metric function, but they can be obtained from the feedback of the researcher users.
